ContactDb
=========
Second try! This one actually worked, so just ignore ContactDatabaseCs. Its only reason for existence is to shame me.
This project uses C# and SQL Server. The sample database I used is included under ContactListDll\bin\Debug.
The zip folder in there contains an older version of the same database in case anyone has any issues, since Visual Studio recently asked to convert it to a newer version.

Anyone using it will need to change the Connection String, which is in ContactListDll/ContactManager.cs until 
a more user-friendly method is added.
